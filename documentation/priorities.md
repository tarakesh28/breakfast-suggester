### BSAv1.0.1 FUTURE PRIORITIES (to be achieved in next version)
#### 🔴 PRIORITY 1 — Make storage mobile-friendly and offline-ready IndexedDB

1. Move all data storage (breakfasts, notes, images) to IndexedDB
   - Chosen over local file storage because browsers cannot reliably read/write local folders.
   - Required to make the app work on mobile devices and as an offline PWA.
   - Removes dependency on a Node server and makes the app usable anywhere once installed.


#### 🟡 PRIORITY 2 — Necessary bug fixes (post-PWA)

1. Modal overlap prevention
   (Reason: Mobile UX breaks badly with stacked modals)
2. Disable background interaction when modal open
   (Reason: Touch devices make this worse than desktop. Accidental taps happen easily)
3. Cleanup images on permanent delete
   (Reason: mobile, storage is more constrained)


#### 🟢 PRIORITY 3 — UX / Quality Improvements

1. Fade-out UI toast notifications
   For:
   ✔ Add Breakfast
   ✔ Move to Recently Deleted
   ✔ Restore
   ✔ Permanent Delete
2. Recently Deleted UI — click row to expand
   Click row → expand → show Restore/Delete
3. Remove “append to script.js” checkbox & also remaining breakfast list code left in script.js
4.	bfasts w/o images should show an option "Click to add image" when suggested which should take you to its breakfast page and let you add image, and when such a bfast is displayed upon clicking suggest button it should show only the name of the bfast and not show an unloaded image icon and text saying breakfast image.
5.	bfast page should also let you edit image not only name and notes
6.	thumbnails to be displayed when b'fasts are listed (all bfast, recently del)
7. Warn only permanent deletion instead of normal delete
8. clicking outside box (all list, recent del list, add) should close the box / action
