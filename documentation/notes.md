#### Notes
BSW v1.4
- removed change-log.md, TasksFor-1.4.md. Going to remove bugs.md in future version. Deletion done because current bugs are mentioned in priorities.md and future features too is saved there and hence Tasks file also not required. New CHANGELOG.md file exists to account for changes, previous bugs fixed, new features added etc.

- BSA = Breakfast Suggestion App
  - BSAv1.0.0 is copy of BSW v1.4. It is created so as to keep BSW v1.4 as a backup.
  - BSA is a well needed renaming
  - Git commits and repo will be in this folder (BSAv1.0.0)
